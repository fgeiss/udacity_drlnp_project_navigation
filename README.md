# Project 01 Navigation for Udacities Deep Reinforcement Learning Nano Degree

## Project Details
The goal of this project is to implement and train an agent with Q-Learning to play a game. The game setting consists of a large square world in which the agent navigates with discrete actions 
- **`0`** move forward
- **`1`** move backward 
- **`2`** turn left
- **`3`** turn right

The aim to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas. The final score is the number of the collected yellow bananas minus the number of the collected blue bananas.

The space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects and walls around the agent's forward direction.
